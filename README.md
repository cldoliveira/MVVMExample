#MVVM Example Implementation

This project is an example of an implementation of MVVM pattern using the technologies below:
- Kotlin
- LiveData for view observation
- Dagger, RxJava and Retrofit for network calls at repository layer
- ViewModel class from google
- Example of unit tests when you are using LiveData

ItÂ´s a simple example. Something may not make sense on your own project.

In this project, we've got two branches:
- master: using dagger for dependency injection
- koin: using koin for dependency injection.
